# Leif Gensert - @leifg

Full time developer since 2008. Started freelancing in 2016. Full time employed again since November 2020 at [TriumphPay](https://triumphpay.com). Building event sourced systems with Ruby.

I contribute to Open Source and implemented a [Live Salesforce Formula Evaluator](https://formulon.io) with open sourced [frontend](http://github.com/leifg/formulon-frontend) and [backend](http://github.com/leifg/formulon). Over the years, I gave [various talks](http://speakerdeck.com/leifg) on local user groups and coached at [Rails Girls workshops](http://railsgirls.com/) in Munich, Paris and Barcelona.

I have [strong opinions on blockchain](https://leif.io/schlockchain)

In my free time I mostly just enjoy my life in Southern California, go on [hikes](https://www.alltrails.com/members/leif-gensert-1) and sometimes [I run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/47862274).
